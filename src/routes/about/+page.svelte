	I am was a chemistry major senior at college in 2020, with 2 years of research experiences. Right
	before my Ph.D application, I decided to something I sincerely love: data visualization. From mid
	2020 and end 2022, I have been severely depressed and unemployed at home due to the pandemic and
	Chinaâ€™s policies against Chinese citizens abroad as well as, oh, green card. I was living in the
	gap between worlds. Pandemic is slowing down. China opened up. My green card arrived in the early
	December. Now I am restarting my life.
